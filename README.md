# Virtualization

 [Virtualization](Image/readme.png)
 
In the context of cloud computing, virtualization refers to the technique of creating virtual instances of computing resources, such as virtual machines (VMs) or containers, within a cloud infrastructure. These virtual instances can emulate the functionality of physical servers, storage devices, networks, or other resources.

Cloud computing providers use virtualization to pool and abstract physical hardware resources, allowing them to be dynamically allocated and shared among multiple users or tenants. Virtualization enables the efficient utilization of hardware, improves scalability and flexibility, and provides isolation between different users or applications.

**Conclusion**
- 	Virtualization by itself allows an organization to utilize and effectively use itâ€˜s IT resources.
- 	Cloud computing takes the use of those resources to another level by delivering access to those components on demand as a service, thus reducing complexity for the end user, cost and burden.
